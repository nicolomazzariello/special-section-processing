# Content

The scripts in this repository allow the analysis of the abstracts of conference track. (in this README "track" and "Special Section" are used as synonyms)
The abstracts are processed with the [`slr-kit`](https://github.com/robolab-pavia/slr-kit) tool.
Each script can be run independently of the others.
The scripts are presented in the order of execution expected during the workflow.

* `--spec_sec_fake`: directory listing of fake Special Sections

Positional arguments:

* `-th`: integer value of the threshold for calculating the coherence, i.e., number of words that two articles must have at least in common within their postprocessed abstract (if not specified, set to 10 by default)

Example of usage:

```
python3 SpecSecElab.py --spec_sec SpecSec/SpecSec* --spec_sec_fake SpecSecFake/SpecSecFake*

Example of usage:

```
python3 SpecSecBoxPlot.py Spec_Sec_metrics.csv Spec_Sec_fake_metrics.csv
```

## `SpecSecPlot.py`

Positional arguments:

* `spec_sec_metrics`: CSV file with the coherence parameters of the Special Sections

Example of usage:

```
python3 SpecSecPlot.py Spec_Sec_metrics.csv Spec_Sec_fake_metrics.csv
```
